PiGlow_Web_Status
=================

This is a small python that will get the web status of a site (in this case http://www.raspberrypi.org/) and relay that to the user through the awesome [PiGlow](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/piglow "PiGlow") by Pimoroni, using the bulit-in module "urllib" as well as an external one - "piglow" created by [Boeeerb](https://github.com/Boeeerb/PiGlow).
